Good day fellow GitHubians

This is a Data Analysis Excel macro that I wrote during a period I worked as a Vacation work student at Kendal Power Station, Mpumalanga, South Africa. It was done in December 2016 to January 2017.
It is to check if maintenance has occured on a Tube Leak Detection(TLD) system with in the Boilers of the units at Kendal Power Station.
A discussion of TLD system is at http://www.acousticmonitoring.com/how-the-acoustic-leak-locator-works/ .

Peace
