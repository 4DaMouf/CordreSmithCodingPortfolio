Good day,

I am a graduated Computer Electronic Engineer from North West University Potchefstroom Campus. I am currently working as a Control and Instrumentation Engineer at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. 

Even though I am currently working as a Control and Instrumentation Engineer my actual passion is Software Development. I am always trying to learn more and tring new languages. The main languages that I work with is C/C++, C# and VB. I also have experience in Phyton, HTML, CSS and PHP. IDE's that I have worked with is Delphi 7, Visual Studios, QT and Anaconda. 

In this Repository you'll find all the major development projects that I have done. For me the two most impressive projects I have worked on is the Worms Game and my Interface for the Digitally Controlled Variable Power Supply, both these can be seen in this repository. 

Thank you for having a look at my Portfolio, if you have any comments you can contact me on smithcordre@gmail.com.

Kind regards.
