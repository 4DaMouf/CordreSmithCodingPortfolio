This is a basic game that I developed based on the classic worms game. This was done for a project during my third year of studies. 
The game was developed utilizing the QT Creator IDE.

The game included:
- Multiple weapons, achieved by implemeting Inheritance and Polymorphism;
- Multiplayer, achieved by using the UDP protocol via a LAN connection;
- Terrain Destruction.

This project still needs finishing touches. It was done during my third year of studies.
Currently no installer available therefor one needs QT to run it. Creating an easy installer is the next step.
