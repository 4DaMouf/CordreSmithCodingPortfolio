Hi fellow Git-hubians

I am a coding junky with a love for anything related to coding.
I am currently in my Final Year of Computer Electronic Engineering and will be finishing at the end of 2017.
All projects that I post is either projects that I have completed for my studies or some hobby project I did, I value constructive criticism.
Feel free to have a look at my Coding projects and suggest some improvements or bugs you can see.

Peace!
