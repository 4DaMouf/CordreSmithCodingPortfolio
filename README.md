# hello-world

Hi fellow Git-hubians

I am a coding junky with a love for anything related to coding, and langauge and any form.
I am currently in my Final Year of Computer Electronic Engineering and will be finishing at the end of 2017.
All projects that I post is either projects that I have completed for my studies or some hobby project I did, I value constructive criticism.
